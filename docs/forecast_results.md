### Forecast Summary
- **Total 12-month forecast**: 278,795,130 crossings
- **Average monthly forecast**: 23,232,927 crossings
- **Current 12-month average**: 29,645,690 crossings
- **Forecast vs recent trend**: **-21.6% decline expected**

## Key Insights

### Historical Context
- **30-year average**: 32,972,664 monthly crossings
- **Recent 5-year average**: 25,373,621 (-23.0% vs historical)
- **Peak month**: 50,196,257 (July 2000)
- **Lowest month**: 9,100,075 (April 2020 - COVID impact)

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Peak months**: July-August (summer travel)
- **Low months**: February (winter)
- **Strong seasonality**: 20-25% variation throughout year

### Long-term Trends
- Significant decline from 2000-2010 peak levels
- COVID-19 caused dramatic 2020 drop
- Partial recovery post-2021 but still below historical norms
- Linear trend model predicts continued gradual decline

## Business Implications

### Resource Planning
- **Capacity planning**: Expect 21.6% lower volumes than recent average
- **Seasonal staffing**: Peak in July-August, minimum in February
- **Budget forecasting**: Plan for continued decline in crossing volumes

### Risk Factors
- Economic conditions could accelerate/decelerate trend
- Policy changes may significantly impact volumes
- External events (pandemics, conflicts) create volatility

## Model Limitations

1. **Simple linear assumption**: May not capture complex non-linear patterns
2. **External factors**: Economic/policy impacts not modeled
3. **Regime changes**: Model assumes current trend continues
4. **Confidence intervals**: Simple baseline methods lack uncertainty quantification

## Recommendations

1. **Use Linear Trend model** for operational planning (best performance)
2. **Monitor quarterly** and retrain models with new data
3. **Develop scenario models** incorporating economic indicators
4. **Implement ensemble approach** combining multiple models
5. **Create alert system** for significant deviations from forecast

## Technical Notes

- Dataset: 355 monthly observations (1996-2025)
- Train/test split: 80/20 (284 train, 71 test months)
- Validation period: Sep 2019 - Jul 2025
- Best parameters: Simple linear regression on time index
- Cross-validation: Time series walk-forward validation
